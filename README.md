MLPC_Classification - Wildfire Severity Prediction
This project implements a Machine Learning-based system to predict wildfire severity using Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. It includes preprocessing, classification, model evaluation, and parallel processing to improve training efficiency. The project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates key concepts in supervised learning.
